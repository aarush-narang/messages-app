add remember me option in signin page?

create visitor page

use diffie hellman for encryption
    uses private keys from both users (private and public keys are both randomly generated each time the user logs in and removed when they logout)

when they load messages page, fetch account data, connect to socket, load groups/dms, etc.

create header component that has links to: home and (account settings, logout, etc. in a dropdown): remains in all pages

store more information about refresh tokens to create a sessions panel with all open sessions and allow more than one refresh token: restore previous sessions if ip is same
come up with ways to remove refresh tokens that are not being used (max number of sessions?)

create "saved!" modal for updating things like account settings, group order, etc.
create modal for creating groups or direct messages
create component for the actual messages
create context menu for groups, messages, people, etc. (like discord)

fix header sizing
create settings page to change username, email, phone #, password, etc as well as to manage sessions panel
