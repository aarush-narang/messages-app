# PRIORITY:
- allow user sign in to be email or username (easy)
- create myaccount page for: account settings (change password, change email, change username, change avatar, delete account, manage sessions panel, phone #?) (hard)
    - SESSIONS PANEL:
        - create a sessions panel with all open sessions: restore previous sessions if ip is same by refreshing access token?
        come up with ways to remove refresh tokens automatically that are not being used (max number of sessions?)

- remove as much duplicate code as possible
- remove all queryselectors or get elements by id or class and replace with useref

## EXTRA:
- add no more messages label above all messages when max msgs is reached
    - if there are no messages, show the group name and a description or help or something
- add option to add passwords to files when uploading
- add markdown support to message box and editing message box
- add code highlight in message box and editing message box
- fix lagging with syntax highlighting
- fix logout issue with brave browser? and other browsers that block tracking and ip grabbing
- show last message in group list
    - shorten if too long
    - if a file is attached with no message, show the file name (shorten if too long)

## BUGS:
- all "FIX" or "TODO" comments
- cannot sign out from mobile
- when user is added, previous messages do not show?
- add error throwing in mongo functions if data is missing

## OTHER:
- create visitor page with parallax effect (use fireship video for tutorial)
- when user leaves or is kicked, not only remove their groups from groups state but also remove all saved messages in their messages state
