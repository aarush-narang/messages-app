add remember me option in signin page?

redirect home page to signin / messages page depending on if user is logged in or not for now
    later create visitor page

research authentication and encryption

when they load messages page, fetch account data, connect to socket, load groups/dms, etc.

create header component that has links to: home and (account settings, logout, etc. in a dropdown): remains in all pages
