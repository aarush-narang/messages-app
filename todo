- fix logout issue with brave browser?
- replace all alerts on frontend with modals
- create context menu for groups, messages, people, etc. (like discord) create event listener on doc and check what was right clicked and based off that change the context menu, add read receipts to this. [Example for custom contextmenu](https://itnext.io/how-to-create-a-custom-right-click-menu-with-javascript-9c368bb58724)

    - messages
    - message edits
    - message deletes

        msgsContainer.scrollTop <= msgsContainer.scrollHeight - (3*msgsContainer.clientHeight)
